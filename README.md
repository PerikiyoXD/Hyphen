# Hyphen
This serializer is highly inspired by ActiveJ and Kryo. It aims to bring insane serialization speed while being easy to use and maintainable.
It uses bytecode generation to create the serializer code at runtime (fully cachable) and then you can use those serializer classes to serialize your object.
